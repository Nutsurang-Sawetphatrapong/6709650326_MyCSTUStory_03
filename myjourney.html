            <h2>Years 1-2:
                In the first two years, students focus on foundational computer science courses such as Introduction to
                Programming, Data Structures, Computational Mathematics, and Algorithms. These courses establish
                essential skills for further studies in computer science. Additionally, students take basic science and
                technology subjects, which provide important context for understanding computing principles.

            <h2>Years 3:
                In the third year, students move on to more advanced topics like System Design and Analysis, Artificial
                Intelligence (AI), Image Processing, and Computer Networks. These courses deepen the students'
                understanding of complex computing systems and prepare them for practical applications in research and
                large-scale projects.

            <h2> Year 4:
                In the final year, students choose elective courses that align with their areas of interest, such as
                Software Development, Data Science, or Networking. They also complete a capstone project or thesis,
                where they apply all the knowledge and skills gained throughout their studies to solve real-world
                problems.
